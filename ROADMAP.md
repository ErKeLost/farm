# RoadMap

Farm has implemented all basic features for a web building tool. However, there is still work to be done to make Farm production-ready.

- [x] Resolving, loading, transforming, and resource generating for web assets (HTML, CSS, JS/JSX/TS/TSX, static assets, and so on).
- [x] Lazy Compilation
- [x] Dev Server and HMR (support React Fast Refresh)
- [x] Partial Bundling
- [x] Both Rust and JavaScript Plugin System
- [x] Source Map
- [x] Resource Minimization
- [x] Tree Shaking
- [x] CSS Modules
- [x] Official Plugins like Sass
- [ ] Persistent Cache
- [x] Polyfill

We look forward to more contributions. Our goal is to provide a high-quality and performant web build tool for the community.
